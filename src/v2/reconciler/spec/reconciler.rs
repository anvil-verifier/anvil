// The only reason that we don't make the types above as associated types is that
// we need to connect this spec Reconciler to the exec Reconciler to pose the proof obligation
// on the reconciler implementation. To do so, the exec Reconciler needs to pose a constraint
// on its S, K, EReq and EResp that their views are the same type as the spec Reconciler's S, K, EReq and EResp
// correspondingly. Since Rust doesn't support type equality constraint (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20041),
// instead of stating the equality constraint, we state that the spec Reconciler is built
// using the views of the exec Reconciler's S, K, EReq and EResp.
