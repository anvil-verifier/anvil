# verifiable-controllers

## Overview

This is an experimental framework to build practical, formally verified, cluster management controllers. The goal is to be able to write a controller in Rust, and have it be formally verified for correctness using the [Verus](https://github.com/secure-foundations/verus/) toolkit.

## Try it out

You cannot compile the verifiable-controllers codebase with a standard rust compiler. You need to use the rust compiler supplied by the Verus project. Follow their [installation instructions](https://github.com/secure-foundations/verus/) to do so.

### Prerequisites

* A Verus installation, using the `main_new` branch

### Build and run

To build and verify the controller examples:
```
$: VERUS_DIR=<path-to-verus> ./build.sh
```

To verify the tla toy examples:
```
$: <path-to-verus>/source/tools/rust-verify.sh src/temporal_logic_examples.rs
```

## Documentation

Our verification approach is described [here](doc/framework_design.md).
